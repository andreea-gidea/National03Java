1. Write a method that can generate the first 100 numbers from Fibonacci series using Java 8 streams 
which returns the sequence as an array of int(BigInteger can fit all 100 Fobonacci numbers).

2. Solve the remaining exercises from the last slide of Lambdas&Streams presentation 
(I pasted them also in the class we've written during course). For each exercise create a separate method 
with an appropriate return type.

By using streams and lamba expressions, implement a small application which:

1.load from a file a structure like

first name, last name, date of birth

2. write back another file containing only

first name, last name 

ordered alphabetically for all the of all matches which have the birthday on a month indicated.

Application takes 3 params:

1. input filename

2. target month (1-12)

3. output file name

Use unit tests to check the correctness.
