Ski Biathlon Standings

Write a software that takes as an input a CSV file where every entry represents the results of a biathlon athlete.

Based on the entries identify the first 3 places (Winner, Runner-up and Third Place).

The rules are simple, each athlete has a time-results for the entire skiing session, and 3 shooting range results.

Each shooting range has 5 shot results. For every missed shot the athlete obtains a 10 second penalty which affects the final time-result.

Final standings are based on the time-results that have been updated with the shooting range results.

CSV example:

11,Umar Jorgson,SK,30:27,xxxox,xxxxx,xxoxo

1,Jimmy Smiles,UK,29:15,xxoox,xooxo,xxxxo

27,Piotr Smitzer,CZ,30:10,xxxxx,xxxxx,xxxxx

Where the columns are:

AthleteNumber,AthleteName,CountryCode,SkiTimeResult(Minutes:Seconds),FirstShootingRange.SecondShooting,ThirShootingeRane

Every shooting range consists of 5 charactes, where x means hit, o mean miss. For every o there should be 10 seconds added to the final time.

Based on the above data the actual results are the following:

Winner - Piotr Smitzer 30:10 (30:10 + 0)

Runner-up - Jimmy Smiles 30:15 (29:15 + 60)

Third Place - Umar Jorgson 30:57 (30:27 + 30)

Task:

Write tests for the CSV parsing and the standing calculation
Use Comparator/Comaparable for sorting
