1. Calculate the sum of the first 100 prime numbers.


2. Display the smallest number from an array of numbers (2 versions: with normal for and with foreach)


3. Display the max digit from a number, read the number from keyboard.


4. Check if a number is palindrom ( e.g palindrom 1221, 34143), read the number from keyboard.


5. Display all the prime numbers lower than a given number, read the number from keyboard


6. Change the implementation of the calculator from the previous meeting to use only if-else instead of switch.


7. Change the implementation of the calculator from the previous meeting to not stop after one calculation. (Hint: put switch inside a while loop)


8. Calculate and display the factorial of a given number n. (ex: 4! = 1*2*3*4)


9. Write a Java program to remove the duplicate elements of a given array and return the new length of the array.

     Sample array: [20, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 50]

     After removing the duplicate elements the program should return [20, 30, 40, 50] as the array without duplicates. 


10. Write a method that checks if the array is square (i.e. every row has the same length as a itself).
a. for input: 

{
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9}
}

should return true

b. for input: 

{
        {1},
        {5, 7, 4},
        {7, 8}
}

should return false

method definition should be: 
public static boolean isSquare(int[][] array)


11. Print the number of days specific to each month in year. 
input: Month (string) of index of the month(1, 2, ... 12)
output: 31, 30, 28


12. Solve all the challenges from the introduction section of the Java roadmap in Hackerrank (see screenshot) except the one with Date and Time:
